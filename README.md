 This is a demonstration of my best practices applied - using the sample project "instacart".
### Objective

A yacht sales company that specializes in luxury yachts.

The company's analysis has shown that the global market for luxury yachts is growing and the marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners.

-  boat sales

### [](https://github.com/malikpressley/Python#tools)Tools

For this project, the following python libraries were used:

-   pandas - for data analysis
-   seaborn - for data visualization

### [](https://github.com/malikpressley/Python#executing-the-code)Executing the code

The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/

To launch the notebook, open the terminal and run the command:

-   importing data: jupyter notebook importData.ipynb

-   generate CrossTabs: jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb
